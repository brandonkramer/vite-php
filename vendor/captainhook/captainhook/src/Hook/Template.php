 * Templates generate the hook sourcecode to place in .git/hooks/* to execute CaptainHook.

 *  - SHELL  Writes a shell script, this is the recommended way for all unix or linux based systems.
 *  - PHP    Writes a PHP script, this is useful if you are running windows and shell scripts aren't an option.
 *  - DOCKER Writes a shell script that executes captainhook inside a docker container. This is useful if you
 *           don't want to install PHP locally.
